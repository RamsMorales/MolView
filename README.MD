For now, this will be a the plan staging area just to keep track of what I am working on. Do I believe that I will update this as time goes on? Not really :P I am a bad programmer after all. I am not even sure that I will complete this. I am just having fun I guess since I have time off from classes. But Maybe I will return to this in the summer. It would be really useful for me to learn the workflow tricks like: updating the git, documenting work, ... things like that. 

## Project Phase Outline

# MolView++ Project Phases

## Phase 1: Foundations
### Goals:
1. Learn C++ basics and object-oriented programming (OOP).
2. Set up the development environment and build tools.
3. Write a basic program to test the setup.

### Tasks:
1. Install Compiler and Build Tools.
2. Choose and configure IDE (VS Code or CLion).
3. Organize project structure with folders for source code, headers, and builds.
4. Write and compile a 'Hello World' program.
5. Install libraries needed for graphics rendering (OpenGL, GLUT, and GLM).
6. Test environment setup with a simple example.

### Deliverables:
- Working development environment.
- Initial program that outputs "Hello, MolView++!"

## Phase 2: Rendering Basics
### Goals:
1. Install and configure graphics libraries (OpenGL, SFML).
2. Render basic 3D shapes for atoms and bonds.
3. Implement transformations for scaling, rotation, and positioning.

### Tasks:
1. Build a 3D rendering window with OpenGL.
2. Implement geometry for atoms (spheres) and bonds (cylinders).
3. Add basic input controls for zoom, rotate, and pan.
4. Test rendering pipeline with sample shapes.

### Deliverables:
- A rendering window displaying simple 3D objects.
- Basic camera controls.

## Phase 3: Molecular Data Handling
### Goals:
1. Parse molecular data formats like PDB and XYZ.
2. Map atomic data into visual representations.
3. Handle large molecule datasets efficiently.

### Tasks:
1. Implement a parser to read molecular files and extract coordinates.
2. Visualize molecular structures using ball-and-stick and space-filling models.
3. Add color mapping based on atom types.

### Deliverables:
- Ability to load and display molecular data.
- Interactive visualization with atomic details.

## Phase 4: Visual Effects and Artistry
### Goals:
1. Add shaders and artistic effects.
2. Create animations for vibrations or rotations.
3. Enhance visual appeal with gradients, fog, and lighting.

### Tasks:
1. Write vertex and fragment shaders using GLSL.
2. Implement glow effects and outlines.
3. Animate molecular structures to simulate motion.

### Deliverables:
- Advanced visualizations with shaders and animations.
- Configurable artistic effects.

## Phase 5: Interactivity and Export Features
### Goals:
1. Add user controls (menus, sliders).
2. Enable exporting screenshots and animations.
3. Support saving modified configurations.

### Tasks:
1. Design a user interface for visualization controls.
2. Implement options for exporting static and animated views.
3. Save molecule states for reuse.

### Deliverables:
- Final interactive tool with export capabilities.
- Comprehensive user manual and documentation.
- Demo video showcasing features.

## Advanced Extensions (Optional)
1. **Physics Simulations:** Add molecular dynamics features.
2. **AI Integration:** Use Python APIs for predictive modeling.
3. **VR/AR Support:** Extend for immersive 3D exploration.
